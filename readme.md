# Polynomial Curve Fitting with TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates polynomial curve fitting using TensorFlow.js and p5.js. It allows you to interactively draw data points on a canvas and fits a polynomial curve to the data using TensorFlow.js.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/polynomial-curve-fitting.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Enter the degree of the polynomial when prompted.

## Usage

- **Adding Data Points**: Click and drag the mouse on the canvas to add data points. The x-coordinate represents the input value, and the y-coordinate represents the target output value.

- **Fitting the Curve**: The program automatically fits a polynomial curve to the data points using TensorFlow.js. The degree of the polynomial is determined by the user input. The fitted curve is displayed on the canvas.

- **Resetting**: To start over, refresh the page.

## Dependencies

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): JavaScript library for creative coding and visualization.

- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js): Library for machine learning in JavaScript.
